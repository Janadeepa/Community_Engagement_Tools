5 . Create views:
    Create EJS templates for rendering the UI. You can have separate views for listing questions, viewing a single question with its answers, etc.

6 . Style your UI:
    Add CSS to style your UI and make it more user-friendly.

7 . Implement features:
    Implement features like upvoting/downvoting questions and answers, sorting questions by popularity, adding tags to questions, etc.

8 . Deploy your app:
    Once you're satisfied with your application, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Heroku so that others can access it.

This is a basic outline to get you started. You'll need to fill in the details, such as defining Mongoose schemas, implementing routes, creating views, and adding functionality to interact with your MongoDB database. 
Additionally, you can expand upon this foundation by adding more features like user authentication, notifications, search functionality, etc.
